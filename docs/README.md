# Introduction

Quill is a programming language with the following properties:
- **Transpiled** - Quill code must be converted into C or Javascript code by the Quill compiler before it can be executed.
- **Statically Typed** - During compilation the Quill compiler detects and reports type errors in your program.
- **Garbage Collected** - Quill uses automatic memory management, meaning it automatically finds and deletes objects that are no longer needed by your program
- **Procedural** - Quill is a procedural language at heart, with influences from functional and object-oriented programming.
- **Simple** - The language's procedural nature allows it to stay simple, yet expressive.

In the following documents you will learn everything you need to read and write your own programs in Quill. They assume some existing programming knowledge.
